## My background
I started programming with my Texas Instrument calculator in high school in 1997.
Fascinated by this universe I followed the SÃ©RÃ©Com training by obtaining my DUT in 2004. 

During my study project I created a website for renting lodgings that I maintained until 2015.
Today it is another provider who takes care of it, but you can see what it looked like with [this link](https://web.archive.org/web/20071129201108/http://www.gitesdethouy.com/index2.html)

From 2004 to 2020 I chose to bring my help to users by being a computer technician then a telecom technician. 
I wanted to find this passion for the code which animated me when I was younger, I then followed a training of **Java Developer Designer** from April to September 2020 and I made an internship until November 2020. This training allowed me to update my skills and to confirm that my passion for code was still there. 

Moreover, at the end of my training I realized that I preferred web technologies to Java. For me, a developer is not limited to one language, and must know how to program in Python as well as in PHP. What is important is to have an algorithmic logic and then knowing how to use this or that language becomes only a detail.

So during my training I worked on two personal projects outside my training.

1. Memory Game

   Find two identical cards to form a pair **HTML and JS**. I created this game initially to teach my son how to use a mouse, that's why the theme is childish :yum:. [Come and try it](http://dix31.org/mesScripts/)<br>
   Here are [the sources of the project](https://github.com/koala819/MemoryGame)
   
2. Cumuler les aides

   A friend of mine asked me to make a questionnaire to help people know the aids they can claim to renovate their house. After answering all the questions, the answers are sent to a google Doc so that my friend can exploit them and contact each person who answered the questionnaire. It's a complete and functional project where I subscribed to a domain name and took care of finding a host. [Come and try it](http://cumulerlesaides.fr)

After that I worked on making my portfolio with Tailwind. I also found and took the domain name ten31 for <b>D</b>eveloper <b>I</b>ndependent <b>X</b>avier :wink:. I subscribed to a hosting offer with the French provider O2switch. To discover [here](http://dix31.org)<br>
